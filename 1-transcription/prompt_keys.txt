You are performing a data entry task and are a master at such tasks.

I will provide you with:
1. A JSONL file containing TMUA questions (each line is a JSON object)
2. An image of the answer key table

Your task is to fill in the "answer_key" field for each question based on the answer key image.

---===---

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. The answer_key is 0-indexed (A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7)

2. Not all 20 questions may be present in the JSONL. You MUST:
   - Identify the question number from the "id" field (e.g., "TMUA_P1_2023_Q07" is Question 7)
   - Match it to the corresponding row in the answer key table image
   - Fill ONLY the matching question's answer_key

3. DO NOT modify ANYTHING else in the JSON objects:
   - Keep prompt, choices, topics, exam, year, difficulty, id exactly as provided
   - Only change the "answer_key" field from null to the correct 0-indexed integer

4. Return a JSON object with a "questions" array containing ALL the modified question objects

---===---

RESPONSE FORMAT:

Return ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact structure:

{
  "questions": [
    { ... first question with answer_key filled ... },
    { ... second question with answer_key filled ... }
  ]
}

---===---

EXAMPLE:

If the input JSONL contains:
{"id": "TMUA_P1_2023_Q03", "answer_key": null, "prompt": "...", ...}
{"id": "TMUA_P1_2023_Q07", "answer_key": null, "prompt": "...", ...}

And the answer key image shows:
Q3 = C
Q7 = E

Then your response should be:
{
  "questions": [
    {"id": "TMUA_P1_2023_Q03", "answer_key": 2, "prompt": "...", ...},
    {"id": "TMUA_P1_2023_Q07", "answer_key": 4, "prompt": "...", ...}
  ]
}
