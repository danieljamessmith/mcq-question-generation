=== STYLE INSTRUCTIONS ===

**Match the style** of the provided examples:
- Question numbering and formatting
- Math notation and display mode usage
- Spacing patterns
- Choice formatting (tabular environment with @{}ll@{} alignment)
- Choice labels (A, B, C, D, etc.)
- Separators between sections (like \hrulefill)
- No trailing punctionation after math mode. End textual sentances with punctiation but never a line ending like "$...\dfrac{3}{2}.$"
- Equations that are central to a question should be formatted using display mode e.g. \[ \lvert x-a\rvert + \lvert x-b\rvert = \lvert a-b\rvert \] is preferred 
  over $\lvert x-a\rvert + \lvert x-b\rvert = \lvert a-b\rvert$ for a question counting the solutions of said equation.

**PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE (STRICT - MUST FOLLOW):**

- **RIGID FORMAT:** **ALWAYS exactly 2 questions per page.** No exceptions.
  
- **Question placement pattern:**
  - **Odd-numbered questions (Q1, Q3, Q5, Q7...):** ALWAYS at the TOP of a page
  - **Even-numbered questions (Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8...):** ALWAYS at the BOTTOM of the same page
  - Each page break occurs after an even-numbered question
  
- **Single `\hrulefill` rule:**
  - **ONE `\hrulefill` per page** - placed BETWEEN the two questions (middle of page)
  - **NO `\hrulefill`** at the end of odd-numbered questions
  - **NO `\hrulefill`** at the end of even-numbered questions
  - The single `\hrulefill` serves as the visual divider between top and bottom questions

- **Spacing pattern (MATCH THE PROVIDED EXAMPLE):**

  For each pair of questions on a page, reproduce the following structure (abstracted from the “perfect” example):

  1. Top (odd-numbered) question:
     - Start directly with the question header and item:
       % ===== QUESTION N =====
       % Answer: ...
       \item
       Question N content...
     - End the final line of the question text with a line break, typically:
       \\[9pt]
     - Then start the choices in a tabular:
       \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
       \textbf{A} & Option A \\[9pt]
       \textbf{B} & Option B \\[9pt]
       ...
       \end{tabular}
       % ===== END QUESTION N =====

  2. Middle-of-page separator:
       \vfill
       \hrulefill
       \vfill

  3. Bottom (even-numbered) question:
       % ===== QUESTION N+1 =====
       % Answer: ...
       \item
       Question N+1 content...
       \\[9pt]

       \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
       \textbf{A} & Option A \\[9pt]
       \textbf{B} & Option B \\[9pt]
       ...
       \end{tabular}
       % ===== END QUESTION N+1 =====

  4. Bottom-of-page and page break:
       \vspace*{40pt}
       \newpage
       \vspace*{15pt}

  - Repeat this pattern for (Q1,Q2), (Q3,Q4), (Q5,Q6), etc., exactly as in the example.
  - After every \newpage, start the next odd-numbered question following the \vspace*{15pt} top margin.

  **Why this works:** Two \vfill commands share available vertical space equally, automatically centering the \hrulefill between them. The combination of \vfill blocks, the fixed \vspace*{40pt} at the bottom of each even-numbered question, and the \vspace*{15pt} after each \newpage reproduces the spacing and layout seen in the provided example pages.

- **Within-question spacing (FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE):** 
  - Between the end of the main question text and the start of the choices, end the last question line with `\\[9pt]` before the `tabular` of options.
  - **Between individual choices:** Use `\\[9pt]` between options inside the `tabular`, as in the example.
  - After the last choice, simply end the `tabular`. Do not add additional large vertical skips at the end of the choices; vertical separation between questions and pages is handled by the surrounding `\vfill`, `\vspace*{40pt}`, and `\vspace*{15pt}` pattern.

**Detect special patterns:**
- Roman numeral statements (I, II, III) should be formatted as an array environment:
  \[
  \begin{array}{@{}l l@{}}
  \textbf{I:} & \text{statement text} \\[2pt]
  \textbf{II:} & \text{statement text}
  \end{array}
  \]
- **CRITICAL - Long text in arrays**: If a statement is too long (>80 characters), BREAK IT ACROSS MULTIPLE ROWS rather than using a single `\text{}` command:
  \[
  \begin{array}{@{}l l@{}}
  \textbf{III:} & \text{Therefore, for every positive integer $n$, the value $n^2+n+41$} \\[2pt]
  & \text{cannot be written as a product of two integers greater than $1$}
  \end{array}
  \]
  NEVER put very long sentences in a single `\text{}` as they will overflow the page. Break at natural phrase boundaries.
  
- **Critical spacing notes (synchronised with the example):**
  - **Top margin after a page break:** use `\vspace*{15pt}` immediately after each `\newpage` before the next odd-numbered question.
  - **Between choices:** use `\\[9pt]` between individual options in `tabular` environments.
  - **Middle of page:** always use `\vfill` → `\hrulefill` → `\vfill` between the top (odd) and bottom (even) questions; this centers the separator.
  - **After odd questions:** end with `\end{tabular}`, then the `\vfill \hrulefill \vfill` block — no extra `\hrulefill` attached to the question itself.
  - **After even questions:** end with `\end{tabular}`, then `\vspace*{40pt} \newpage \vspace*{15pt}` — no extra `\hrulefill` attached to the question itself.
  - This pattern exactly matches the layout and spacing used in the supplied “perfect” LaTeX example.

- **Formal statements or definitions** (especially those serving as the target of a negation question) should be formatted using a centered array environment:
  \[
  \begin{array}{c}
  \text{for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$,} \\[2pt]
  \text{if $|x-x_0|<\delta$ then $|f(x)-f(x_0)|<\varepsilon$}
  \end{array}
  \]
  
- **Display mode for key equations/definitions**:
  - Equations central to the question should use `\[ \]` display mode
  - Function definitions in question text should use display mode: `\[f(x) = a^{\cos x} + a^{-\cos x}\]`
  - Graph equations should use `\[ \]` or `\begin{align*}...\end{align*}` for multiple equations
  - Statement references like $(\ast)$ should be center-aligned when defining them:
    \[\text{statement content here}\tag{$\ast$}\]
    or
    \[
    \begin{array}{c}
    \text{statement content}
    \end{array}
    \tag{$\ast$}
    \]
- Multi-line prompts with display math should use \[...\] notation
- Inline math should use $...$ notation

**MATHEMATICAL LOGIC NOTATION** (CRITICAL - REPLACE ANY FORBIDDEN NOTATION IN INPUT)

**FORBIDDEN NOTATIONS - MUST BE REPLACED:**
- `\land` → Replace with text: "$P$ \textbf{and} $Q$" (bold the word "and")
- `\lor` → Replace with text: "$P$ \textbf{or} $Q$" (bold the word "or")
- `\lnot` → USE THIS! For logical negation, `$\lnot P$` is PREFERRED and CORRECT. Do NOT replace this.
- `\Rightarrow` → Replace with text depending on context:
  - "$P \Rightarrow Q$" becomes "$P$ is \textbf{sufficient} for $Q$" or "$Q$ \textbf{if} $P$" or "\textbf{if} $P$ \textbf{then} $Q$"
  - NEVER use the word "implies" - it's forbidden. Use "sufficient", "if...then", or other variations.
- `\Leftarrow` → Replace with text: "$P$ is \textbf{necessary} for $Q$"
- `\Leftrightarrow` → Replace with text: "\textbf{if and only if}" (written out fully)
  - ✓ CORRECT: "\textbf{if and only if}" (this is what you want!)
  - ✗ FORBIDDEN: "iff" (the abbreviation - replace with full phrase)

**EVEN IF THE INPUT JSON CONTAINS THESE SYMBOLS, YOU MUST REPLACE THEM.**

**CLARIFICATION:** Only replace violations. If input already uses "\textbf{if and only if}" written out, that's perfect - keep it!

**Additional rules:**
- FORBIDDEN WORDS: 
  - "implies" - NEVER use this word. Replace with "if...then", "sufficient", etc.
  - "iff" (abbreviation) - NEVER use this abbreviation. Replace with "if and only if" written out fully
  - Note: "if and only if" written out in full is CORRECT and should be kept!

**BOLDING RULES (CRITICAL - APPLY EVERYWHERE):**
- Logic-technical terms MUST be \textbf{bolded} **EVERYWHERE they appear** (not just in choices/quotes):
  - "necessary", "sufficient", "if...then", "and" (in logic context), "or" (in logic context), "not" (in logic context)
- This includes **in the question text itself**: "Which is/are \textbf{sufficient} to guarantee..."
- This includes **in the answer choices**: "\textbf{necessary} but \textbf{not sufficient}"
- Exception: "and"/"or" are only bolded when used in a logical/propositional sense, not everyday language

**Examples:**
- ✓ "Which of these is/are \textbf{sufficient} to guarantee..." (question text)
- ✓ "individually \textbf{necessary} for $ABCD$..." (question text)  
- ✓ "\textbf{necessary} but \textbf{not sufficient}" (answer choice)
- ✗ "sufficient to guarantee" (not bolded - WRONG)

- Use textual variations (encouraged for testing comprehension): "if P then Q" = "P is sufficient for Q" = "Q if P" = "Q is necessary for P"

**OTHER MATHEMATICAL NOTATION**
- **Divisibility**: ALWAYS prefer "$n^3-n$ is divisible by $12$" over "$12$ divides $n^3-n$". The "divisible by" phrasing is clearer for students.
- Avoid interval notation like $[1,3]$ or $(\infty, infty)$. Preferred is always inequality notation such as $1 \le x \le 3$ or "for all real $x$" respectively.
- Avoid set notation. Instead of writing $x\in\{a,b\}$ write "$x=a$ or $x=b$"
- **Avoid niche terminology** without definition: Terms like "coincident", "parity" are too advanced. REPLACE with plain language:
  - **"coincident"** → REPLACE with plain description:
    - "the circles are not coincident" → "the circles do not have the same center and radius" or "the circles are distinct"
  - **"parity"** → REPLACE with plain language:
    - "$a$ and $b$ have the same parity" → "$a$ and $b$ are both even or both odd"
  - If you see these terms in input JSON, **you MUST replace them** even if they seem correct
