=== GLOBAL LEVEL & NOTATION INSTRUCTIONS (TMUA) ===

These instructions apply to BOTH:
- Question generation (JSON questions with LaTeX in strings)
- LaTeX extraction/formatting (when converting JSON questions to LaTeX)

They are about LEVEL + MATHEMATICAL NOTATION / WORDING (not LaTeX layout, spacing, tables, etc.).

---===---

LEVEL (SCOPE)
- Audience: advanced high-school students; strictly below undergraduate level.
- The TMUA Content Specification defines the default assumed knowledge.
- Off-spec content is allowed ONLY if every required off-spec concept/term is explicitly defined in the question body in plain language, so that a TMUA-level student can solve it.

---===---

LOGIC / PROOF NOTATION (FORBIDDEN)
- Do NOT use any of these logical symbols in generated question text:
  - $\Leftarrow$, $\Rightarrow$, $\Leftrightarrow$
  - $\land$, $\lor$
- Do NOT use the words:
  - "implies"
  - "iff" (abbreviation)
- Allowed / preferred alternatives:
  - Write "if ... then ..." or "if and only if" (written out in full)
  - Use textual "and" / "or" instead of $\land$ / $\lor$
  - Use "necessary" / "sufficient" phrasing where natural
  - Logical negation $\lnot$ is allowed and preferred if you need symbolic negation

---===---

REQUIRED / PREFERRED PHRASINGS
- Divisibility: ALWAYS say "$n^3-n$ is divisible by $12$" (preferred)
  NEVER say "$12$ divides $n^3-n$".
- Avoid niche terminology without replacement/definition:
  - "parity" → replace with: "$a$ and $b$ are both even or both odd"
  - "coincident" → replace with: "the circles are distinct" or
    "the circles do not have the same center and radius"

---===---

OTHER NOTATION PREFERENCES
- Avoid interval notation like $[1,3]$ or $(1,3)$.
  Prefer inequality notation like $1 \le x \le 3$ or $1 < x < 3$.
  For unbounded ranges, prefer plain language such as "for all real $x$".
- Avoid set-brace membership notation like $x \in \{a,b\}$.
  Prefer writing "x=a or x=b" (or equivalent plain-language disjunction).
