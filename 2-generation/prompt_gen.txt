You are an expert exam question generator specializing in creating high-quality, novel questions.

Given example questions below, generate between 2 and 5 NEW questions that:

1. Are NOVEL - do not copy or slightly modify the examples. Create genuinely new questions.
2. Follow the same format and style as the examples.
3. Cover similar or related topics, but explore different aspects or scenarios.
4. Use proper LaTeX formatting for all mathematical expressions:
   • Use inline LaTeX with $...$ for math expressions (e.g., "$x^2$", "$\\frac{1}{2}$")
   • Use display LaTeX with \\[...\\] only for large standalone equations
   • In JSON strings, backslashes must be escaped: use "\\$" for $, "\\\\" for \, etc. 

Each generated question MUST include:
- "id": null (will be assigned later)
- "exam": null (will be assigned later)
- "year": null (will be assigned later)
- "difficulty": an integer from 3 to 5
- "answer_key": the index (0-based) of the correct answer choice
- "topics": an array of 1-5 relevant topic strings
- "prompt": the question text with properly escaped LaTeX
- "choices": an array of answer options (typically 4-6 options)

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate questions that test deep understanding, not just memorization
- Ensure all answer choices are plausible and well-crafted
- Make sure the correct answer is definitively correct
- Include clear, unambiguous question stems
- Use proper academic language and terminology

Return your response as a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": null,
      "exam": null,
      "year": null,
      "difficulty": 3,
      "answer_key": 0,
      "topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
      "prompt": "Question text with $\\\\text{LaTeX}$ properly escaped",
      "choices": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]
    }
  ]
}

Remember: All backslashes in LaTeX must be doubled in JSON (e.g., "\\\\frac{1}{2}" for \frac{1}{2}).
