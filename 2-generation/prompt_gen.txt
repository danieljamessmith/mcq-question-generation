You are an expert exam question generator specializing in creating high-quality, novel questions.

---===---

Given example questions below, generate less than 8 NEW questions that:

1. Are NOVEL - do not copy or slightly modify the examples. Create genuinely new questions.
   *CRITICALLY* small pertubations of the given examples are NOT encouraged. Your aim is to generate novel, interesting, unseen questions. 
2. Follow the same format and style as the examples.
3. Cover similar or related topics, but explore different aspects or scenarios.
4. Use proper LaTeX formatting for all mathematical expressions:
   • Use inline LaTeX with $...$ for math expressions (e.g., "$x^2$", "$\\frac{1}{2}$")
   • Use display LaTeX with \\[...\\] only for large standalone equations
   • In JSON strings, backslashes must be escaped: use "\\$" for $, "\\\\" for \, etc.

COUNT POLICY (quality-gated):
- You may output ANY number of questions from 1 to 7 inclusive.
- Choose the count organically based on how many input examples you received (N) and how many strong, distinct ideas you can produce WITHOUT padding.
- Prefer FEWER high-quality questions over MORE weaker ones. Do NOT add extra questions just to reach a maximum.
- Only output 7 if you truly have 7 strong, clearly distinct questions.”

Soft guidance (not a target):
- If N ≤ 2: typically 1–4 questions
- If 3 ≤ N ≤ 5: typically 2–5 questions
- If 6 ≤ N ≤ 8: typically 3–6 questions
- If N ≥ 9: typically 4–7 questions

Stopping rule:
- Stop generating as soon as any additional question would be noticeably weaker, repetitive, derivative of an example, or too similar to another generated question.

---===---

Each generated question MUST include:
- "id": null (will be assigned later)
- "exam": null (will be assigned later)
- "year": null (will be assigned later)
- "difficulty": null (not generated - will be assigned later if needed)
- "answer_key": the index (0-based) of the correct answer choice
- "topics": an array of 1-5 relevant topic strings
- "prompt": the question text with properly escaped LaTeX
- "choices": an array of answer options (typically 4-6 options)

---===---

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate questions that test deep understanding, not just memorization
- Ensure all answer choices are plausible and well-crafted
- Make sure the correct answer is definitively correct
- Include clear, unambiguous question stems
- Use proper academic language and terminology

Return your response as a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": null,
      "exam": null,
      "year": null,
      "difficulty": null,
      "answer_key": 0,
      "topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
      "prompt": "Question text with $\\\\text{LaTeX}$ properly escaped",
      "choices": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]
    }
  ]
}

Remember: All backslashes in LaTeX must be doubled in JSON (e.g., "\\\\frac{1}{2}" for \frac{1}{2}).

GLOBAL LEVEL & NOTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
These are standardized across the project and will be appended to the end of the full prompt at runtime.
Treat them as binding requirements.
