=== LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS ===
---
Questions should be level-appropriate for an advanced high-school student but are strictly LOWER level than undergraduate level. 
---
So, in particular, no direct knowledge of:
[Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Modular Arithmatic, etc] should be required. 
Questions that *indirectly* touch on such topics without e.g. the specific notations are fine. 
---
Do not use $Leftarrow$, $\Rightarrow$ or $\Leftrightarrow$. Preferred is always textual synonyms like "necessary", "sufficient" "if and only if" etc. 
---
In fact, somewhat arbitary permuatation of such terms 
(e.g. "P implies Q" is the same as "P is sufficient for Q" is the same as "Q if P" is the same as "Q is necessary for P" etc etc) 
is encouraged as the TMUA directly tests this.
