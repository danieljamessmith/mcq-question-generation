=== LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS ===
---
Questions should be level-appropriate for an advanced high-school student but are strictly LOWER level than undergraduate level.
The TMUA Content Specification (appended at the end of this prompt) defines the exact scope of mathematical knowledge that can be assumed.
---
So, in particular, no direct knowledge of:
[Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Modular Arithmetic, etc] should be required. 
Questions that *indirectly* touch on such topics without e.g. the specific notations are fine.
Off-spec topics ARE ALLOWED if and only if all required terms/concepts are explicitly defined within the question body itself.

**MATHEMATICAL NOTATION RULES:**

**FORBIDDEN SYMBOLS/WORDS:**
- Do NOT use $\Leftarrow$, $\Rightarrow$ or $\Leftrightarrow$. Use textual synonyms like "necessary", "sufficient", "if...then", "if and only if"
- Do NOT use $\land$ or $\lor$. Use textual "and"/"or" instead
- Do NOT use the WORDS "implies" or "iff" - they are forbidden. Use "if...then", "sufficient", or "if and only if" (written out fully)
- $\lnot$ is ALLOWED and PREFERRED for logical negation

**REQUIRED PHRASINGS:**
- **Divisibility**: ALWAYS say "$n^3-n$ is divisible by $12$" NEVER say "$12$ divides $n^3-n$"
- **Avoid advanced jargon**: NEVER use these terms without replacement:
  - "parity" → say "$a$ and $b$ are both even or both odd" instead of "same parity"
  - "coincident" → say "the circles are distinct" or "do not have the same center and radius"
  - Use plain language that an advanced high-school student would understand

**Textual variation of logical terms** is encouraged (the TMUA tests this):
- "if P then Q" = "P is sufficient for Q" = "Q if P" = "Q is necessary for P"
- Vary these phrasings naturally in questions.
