You are an expert exam question critic and validator. Your task is to evaluate whether a generated exam question is well-posed and whether the answer key is correct.

For the question provided below, you must:

1. Assess if the question is WELL-POSED:
   - Is the question statement clear and unambiguous?
   - Are all necessary conditions and constraints specified?
   - Are the answer choices distinct and non-overlapping?
   - Are all answer choices plausible?
   - Does the question test genuine mathematical understanding (not just memorization)?

2. Verify the ANSWER KEY is CORRECT:
   - Work through the problem mathematically
   - Verify that the answer_key (0-indexed) points to the correct choice
   - Ensure no other choices could be considered correct
   - Check for any mathematical errors in the answer choices

3. Check LEVEL-APPROPRIATENESS (using the TMUA Content Specification appended below):
   - The question should only require knowledge covered in the TMUA spec
   - OFF-SPEC content IS ALLOWED if and only if:
     * All off-spec terms, concepts, and definitions are explicitly provided in the question body
     * A student with only TMUA-level knowledge could understand and solve the question
   - INVALID examples (should FAIL):
     * Using terms like "differentiable almost everywhere", "Cauchy sequence", "modular arithmetic" 
       without defining them in the question
     * Assuming knowledge of undergraduate-level concepts not in the spec
   - VALID examples (should PASS):
     * "A sequence $(a_n)$ is called 'splendid' if [definition]. Which of the following..."
     * Questions that define any advanced terms they use within the question body

Return your evaluation as a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "well_posed": true or false,
  "answer_correct": true or false,
  "level_appropriate": true or false,
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of your evaluation, including any mathematical working and level-appropriateness assessment",
  "overall_pass": true or false
}

Set "overall_pass" to true ONLY if ALL of "well_posed", "answer_correct", and "level_appropriate" are true.

Be thorough in your mathematical verification. If you find any ambiguity, error, or issue, set the relevant field to false and explain clearly in the reasoning.

=== LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS ===
---
Questions should be level-appropriate for an advanced high-school student but are strictly LOWER level than undergraduate level.
The TMUA Content Specification (appended at the end of this prompt) defines the exact scope of mathematical knowledge that can be assumed.
---
So, in particular, no direct knowledge of:
[Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Modular Arithmetic, etc] should be required. 
Questions that *indirectly* touch on such topics without e.g. the specific notations are fine.
Off-spec topics ARE ALLOWED if and only if all required terms/concepts are explicitly defined within the question body itself.

**MATHEMATICAL NOTATION RULES:**

**FORBIDDEN SYMBOLS/WORDS:**
- Do NOT use $\Leftarrow$, $\Rightarrow$ or $\Leftrightarrow$. Use textual synonyms like "necessary", "sufficient", "if...then", "if and only if"
- Do NOT use $\land$ or $\lor$. Use textual "and"/"or" instead
- Do NOT use the WORDS "implies" or "iff" - they are forbidden. Use "if...then", "sufficient", or "if and only if" (written out fully)
- $\lnot$ is ALLOWED and PREFERRED for logical negation

**REQUIRED PHRASINGS:**
- **Divisibility**: ALWAYS say "$n^3-n$ is divisible by $12$" NEVER say "$12$ divides $n^3-n$"
- **Avoid advanced jargon**: NEVER use these terms without replacement:
  - "parity" → say "$a$ and $b$ are both even or both odd" instead of "same parity"
  - "coincident" → say "the circles are distinct" or "do not have the same center and radius"
  - Use plain language that an advanced high-school student would understand

**Textual variation of logical terms** is encouraged (the TMUA tests this):
- "if P then Q" = "P is sufficient for Q" = "Q if P" = "Q is necessary for P"
- Vary these phrasings naturally in questions.
